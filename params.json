  "body": "## Introduction\r\n\r\nMost of the current databases like Oracle, PostgreSQL, HSQL support the notion of CREATING AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS . This notion is missing from MariaDB, so this project deals with creating the support for aggregate functions for MariaDB. To incorporate the support for the aggregate stored functions first we had to form the syntax for these functions and then a design plan on how we are going to implement these functions. \r\n\r\n## Work Done\r\n\r\n### Adding the syntax to the parser\r\n\r\n*  Added the AGGREGATE keyword to the parser, so as to support the new syntax for creating aggregate functions. A test has been written to check that the parser parses the AGGREGATE keyword correctly\r\n\r\n   Link to the test [test](https://github.com/MariaDB/server/commit/b3577bcdbb9cd4c269a57cadc62ac04dd42f0ca4)\r\n\r\n*  Added an agg_type field to the sp_chistics.\r\n\r\nlink:\r\n\r\n*  Added the FETCH GROUP NEXT ROW instruction: This instruction is exclusive for aggregate functions.This instruction is added to make\r\na temporary exit from the function execution. After the temporary exit is made the values are set to the parameters of the function\r\nand then the function resumes execution.\r\n\r\n*  Alter and show Aggregate functions:\r\nThe create query should store if the function is an aggregate function or not in the aggregate\r\nfield of the mysql.proc table.\r\nAlter query should allow user to change the aggregate field of the mysql.proc table.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Added the implementation of the item_sum_sp class\r\n\r\n1) Item_sum_sp class inherited from Item_sum\r\n2) Add function\r\n3) val_xxxx\r\n\r\n### Adding the execution of aggregate functions\r\n\r\n1)sp_head::execute_aggregate_function\r\n2) sp_head::execute_agg\r\n\r\n### Approach taken\r\n1) Cursor approach\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n",
