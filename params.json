  "body": "## Introduction\r\n\r\nMost of the current databases like Oracle, PostgreSQL, HSQL support the notion of CREATING AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS . This notion is missing from MariaDB, so this project deals with creating the support for aggregate functions for MariaDB. To incorporate the support for the aggregate stored functions first we had to form the syntax for these functions and then a design plan on how we are going to implement these functions. \r\n\r\n## Work Done\r\n1. Added the AGGREGATE symbol to the parser. Also added the FETCH GROUP NEXT ROW instruction(exclusive for aggregate functions) to the parser.\r\n\r\n2. \r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\n",
