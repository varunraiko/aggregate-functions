  "body": "## Introduction\r\n\r\nMost of the current databases like Oracle, PostgreSQL, HSQL support the notion of CREATING AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS . This notion is missing from MariaDB, so this project deals with creating the support for aggregate functions for MariaDB. To incorporate the support for the aggregate stored functions first we had to form the syntax for these functions and then a design plan on how we are going to implement these functions. \r\n\r\n## Work Done\r\n\r\n### Added the syntax for the Aggregate Functions to the parser\r\n\r\n*  Added the AGGREGATE symbol to the parser. A test has been written to check that the parser parses the AGGREGATE keyword correctly.\r\n\r\n   Link to the [commit](https://github.com/MariaDB/server/commit/dbff33cc32ec0c4a90327a7c91a930b34e16e4f3)\r\n\r\n*  Added the FETCH GROUP NEXT ROW instruction: This instruction is exclusive for aggregate functions.This instruction is added to make a temporary exit from the function execution. After the temporary exit is made the values are set to the parameters of the function\r\nand then the function resumes execution.\r\n\r\n   Link to the [commit](https://github.com/MariaDB/server/commit/65782a2a6b5ad3db466953b6ea46f87de2616723)\r\n   \r\n*  Added an agg_type field to the st_sp_chistics. This has been added to help us store in the mysql.proc table whether a function is aggregate, window or normal function.\r\n   Link to the [type aggregate_type] (https://github.com/varunraiko/aggregate-functions/blob/aggregate-functions/sql/sql_lex.h#L170-L176).\r\n   Link to the field added to the [st_sp_chistics] (https://github.com/varunraiko/aggregate-functions/blob/aggregate-functions/sql/sql_lex.h#L1104-L1111).\r\n\r\n*  Alter and show Aggregate functions:\r\nThe create query should store if the function is an aggregate function or not in the aggregate\r\nfield of the mysql.proc table.\r\nAlter query should allow user to change the aggregate field of the mysql.proc table.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Added the implementation of the item_sum_sp class\r\n\r\n1) Item_sum_sp class inherited from Item_sum\r\n2) Add function\r\n3) val_xxxx\r\n\r\n### Adding the execution of aggregate functions\r\n\r\n1)sp_head::execute_aggregate_function\r\n2) sp_head::execute_agg\r\n\r\n### Approach taken\r\n1) Cursor approach\r\n\r\n### Testing",
